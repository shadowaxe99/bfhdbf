# Orbit AI Development Kit API Reference

## Overview

The Orbit AI Development Kit is a comprehensive suite of tools, libraries, and APIs designed to facilitate the development of AI agents within the Elysium OS ecosystem. This development kit is optimized for creating AI entities that can operate effectively in a 360-degree 'Orbit', providing a seamless interaction with the user's digital environment.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Orbit AI Development Kit, ensure that you have the latest version of Elysium OS installed. Follow the setup guide in `docs/developer-guide/2-setup.md` to configure your development environment.

## Key Features

### 1. Orbit Initialization

To initialize the Orbit environment for your AI agent, use the `initializeOrbit` function from the `OrbitService`.

```typescript
import { initializeOrbit } from 'src/services/OrbitService';

const orbitInstance = initializeOrbit();
```

### 2. AI Entity Creation

Create new AI entities using the `createAIEntity` function. Define the entity's characteristics and capabilities as per the requirements.

```typescript
import { createAIEntity } from 'src/services/AIService';
import { AIEntity } from 'src/types/index.d.ts';

const newAIEntity: AIEntity = createAIEntity({
  name: 'Aide',
  personality: 'Helper',
  capabilities: ['scheduling', 'reminder'],
});
```

### 3. Interaction Framework

Utilize the `InteractionFramework` component to handle interactions between the AI entities and the user's environment.

```typescript
import InteractionFramework from 'src/components/InteractionFramework/InteractionFramework';

const interactionHandler = new InteractionFramework(orbitInstance);
```

### 4. Event Handling

Register and handle events using the `onEvent` and `emitEvent` methods to facilitate communication between AI entities and other components within the Orbit.

```typescript
interactionHandler.onEvent('userAction', (data) => {
  // Handle user action
});

interactionHandler.emitEvent('aiResponse', {
  message: 'Task scheduled successfully',
});
```

### 5. Data Persistence

For data persistence and state management across sessions, use the `AIStore` and `OrbitStore` from the `src/store` directory.

```typescript
import { AIStore, OrbitStore } from 'src/store';

const aiState = AIStore.getState();
const orbitState = OrbitStore.getState();
```

### 6. Simulation and Testing

The `SimulationTestingEnvironment` component provides a virtual environment for testing AI agents and their interactions.

```typescript
import SimulationTestingEnvironment from 'src/components/SimulationTestingEnvironment/SimulationTestingEnvironment';

const simulationEnv = new SimulationTestingEnvironment();
simulationEnv.runTestSuite();
```

## API Methods

Below is a list of available methods and their descriptions:

- `initializeOrbit()`: Initializes the Orbit environment for AI entities.
- `createAIEntity(config)`: Creates a new AI entity with the specified configuration.
- `onEvent(eventName, callback)`: Registers an event listener for the given event name.
- `emitEvent(eventName, data)`: Emits an event with the provided data payload.
- `getState()`: Retrieves the current state from the AI or Orbit store.

## Data Structures

Refer to `src/types/index.d.ts` for the type definitions and interfaces used within the Orbit AI Development Kit.

## Examples

For practical examples and use cases, refer to `docs/developer-guide/4-components.md` and `docs/developer-guide/5-services.md`.

## Support
