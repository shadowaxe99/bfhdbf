# Interaction Framework API Reference

## Overview

The Interaction Framework is a comprehensive suite of tools and APIs designed to facilitate seamless interaction between AI agents and the user's digital environment within the Elysium OS ecosystem. This document serves as an API reference guide for developers looking to integrate the Interaction Framework into their AI-driven applications.

## Introduction

The 360-Degree Interaction Framework provides a set of APIs that enable AI agents to interact with various components of the user's environment, such as other AI entities, system notifications, and user inputs. It is designed to work in tandem with the Orbit AI Development Kit to create a cohesive experience.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Interaction Framework, ensure that you have the latest version of the Elysium OS SDK installed. Import the Interaction Framework module into your project using:

```typescript
import { InteractionFramework } from 'src/components/InteractionFramework';
```

## API Endpoints

### `initializeInteractionFramework`

Initializes the interaction framework for use within the application.

```typescript
function initializeInteractionFramework(): Promise<void>;
```

### `registerAIEntity`

Registers an AI entity with the interaction framework to enable communication.

```typescript
function registerAIEntity(entityId: string, callback: (event: CustomEvent) => void): void;
```

### `unregisterAIEntity`

Unregisters an AI entity, removing it from the interaction framework.

```typescript
function unregisterAIEntity(entityId: string): void;
```

### `sendEventToEntity`

Sends an event to a specific AI entity registered within the framework.

```typescript
function sendEventToEntity(entityId: string, event: CustomEvent): void;
```

### `broadcastEvent`

Broadcasts an event to all registered AI entities.

```typescript
function broadcastEvent(event: CustomEvent): void;
```

## Event Handling

The Interaction Framework uses a custom event system to handle communication between AI entities. Events are objects that contain a `type` property indicating the nature of the event and an optional `detail` property containing additional data.

### Custom Event Types

- `AIEntityRegistered`: Fired when an AI entity is successfully registered.
- `AIEntityUnregistered`: Fired when an AI entity is unregistered.
- `UserInteraction`: Represents an interaction initiated by the user.
- `SystemNotification`: Represents a system-level notification or alert.

### Handling Events

To handle events, AI entities must register a callback function that will be invoked when an event is received.

```typescript
function handleAIEvent(event: CustomEvent): void {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'UserInteraction':
      // Handle user interaction
      break;
    case 'SystemNotification':
      // Handle system notification
      break;
    // Add additional cases as needed
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The Interaction Framework provides error handling mechanisms to ensure robustness. Errors are communicated through a `FrameworkError` event.

### Framework Error Event

```typescript
interface FrameworkErrorEventDetail {
  code: string;
  message: string;
}

const frameworkErrorEvent = new CustomEvent<FrameworkErrorEventDetail>('FrameworkError', {
  detail: {
    code: 'ERROR_CODE',
    message: 'Error message'
  }
});
```

## Best Practices

- Always unregister AI entities when they are no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
- Use specific event types to avoid collisions and ensure clear communication.
- Implement comprehensive error handling to improve the user experience.
