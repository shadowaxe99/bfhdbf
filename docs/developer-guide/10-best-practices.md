# Best Practices for Developing AI Agents in Elysium OS

## Introduction

This guide outlines the best practices for developing AI agents using TypeScript and React components within the Elysium OS ecosystem. Adhering to these practices will ensure that your AI agents are efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

## 1. Consistent Coding Style

- Use `ESLint` and `Prettier` with the provided configuration files to maintain a consistent coding style.
- Follow the naming conventions outlined in `src/types/index.d.ts` for type definitions.

## 2. Component Structure

- Keep your React components small and focused. Break down large components into smaller sub-components.
- Use the folder structure outlined in `src/components/` to organize your components logically.

## 3. Type Safety

- Always define TypeScript interfaces and types for props, state, and events in your components.
- Use TypeScript's strict mode to catch potential type errors during development.

## 4. State Management

- Use Redux with the provided `src/store/` setup for global state management.
- For local state, use React's `useState` or `useReducer` hooks.

## 5. Context and Hooks

- Utilize `AIContext` and `OrbitContext` from `src/context/` for providing global data and functions.
- Implement custom hooks like `useAI` and `useOrbit` for shared logic across components.

## 6. API Integration

- Use the services defined in `src/services/` for interacting with backend APIs.
- Handle API responses and errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user.

## 7. Performance Optimization

- Use React's `memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary renders.
- Implement lazy loading for components and routes using `React.lazy` and `React.Suspense`.

## 8. Accessibility

- Ensure that your components are accessible by following WAI-ARIA guidelines.
- Use semantic HTML and manage focus correctly for keyboard and screen reader users.

## 9. Testing

- Write unit tests for your components and services using Jest and React Testing Library as set up in `src/setupTests.ts`.
- Aim for a high level of test coverage to ensure reliability.

## 10. Documentation

- Document your components and functions using JSDoc style comments.
- Update the developer guide in `docs/developer-guide/` to reflect changes and decisions.

## 11. Security

- Follow security best practices for React and TypeScript development.
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS attacks and validate props with PropTypes or TypeScript.

## 12. Error Handling

- Implement robust error handling using try-catch blocks and error boundaries in React.
- Log errors for debugging purposes but avoid exposing sensitive information to the user.

## 13. Scalability

- Design your components and state management with scalability in mind.
- Use code splitting and dynamic imports to reduce the initial load time.

## 14. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Integrate your project with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Use the configuration files in `src/config/` to manage environment-specific settings.

## 15. Code Reviews

- Conduct thorough code reviews to catch issues and ensure code quality.
- Use pull requests and adhere to the project's contribution guidelines.

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help you build robust, efficient, and maintainable AI agents for the Elysium OS ecosystem. Always keep the user experience in mind and strive to enhance the capabilities of the Orbit AI Development Kit and the 360-Degree Interaction Framework.
