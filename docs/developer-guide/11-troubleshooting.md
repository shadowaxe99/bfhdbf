# Elysium Innovations Developer Guide

## 11. Troubleshooting

This section of the developer guide is dedicated to helping you troubleshoot common issues you may encounter while working with the Elysium Innovations Developer Tools. We have compiled a list of frequent problems, their possible causes, and steps to resolve them.

### 11.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### 11.1.1 Application Fails to Compile

**Symptom:**
The application does not compile, and the terminal shows TypeScript or syntax errors.

**Possible Causes:**
- Missing or incorrect imports.
- Type mismatches in TypeScript files.
- Syntax errors in TypeScript or JSX.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Check the terminal output for file paths and line numbers related to the error.
2. Verify that all imports are correct and that all required modules are installed.
3. Ensure that all TypeScript types are correctly defined and used.
4. Review the syntax of the affected files for any typos or errors.

#### 11.1.2 Components Not Rendering

**Symptom:**
A component does not render on the page, or renders incorrectly.

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect usage of React hooks or lifecycle methods.
- State or props not being passed correctly.
- CSS/Styles not applied or conflicting.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Use React Developer Tools to inspect the component hierarchy and state/props.
2. Check the component's render method or function for any conditional rendering issues.
3. Review the associated styles and ensure that the CSS classes are applied correctly.

#### 11.1.3 API Calls Failing

**Symptom:**
API calls to backend services are failing or returning unexpected results.

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect API endpoint or HTTP method.
- Backend service is down or unreachable.
- Authentication or authorization issues.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Verify the API endpoint and method in the `AIService` or other relevant service files.
2. Check the network tab in the browser's developer tools for the status code and response.
3. Ensure that any required authentication tokens or credentials are being sent correctly.

#### 11.1.4 State Management Issues

**Symptom:**
Application state is not updating as expected, leading to UI inconsistencies.

**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect usage of Redux actions or reducers.
- Mutating state directly instead of using immutable patterns.
- Selectors not retrieving the correct slice of state.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Review the `actions`, `reducers`, and `selectors` in the `store` directory for any logic errors.
2. Ensure that state updates are done immutably, without directly modifying the current state.
3. Use Redux Developer Tools to trace the state changes and action dispatches.

#### 11.1.5 Performance Bottlenecks

**Symptom:**
The application is slow or unresponsive, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex UIs.

**Possible Causes:**
- Inefficient rendering or re-rendering of components.
- Large state or context causing unnecessary updates.
- Expensive computations or operations in the render path.

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Use the Profiler in React Developer Tools to identify components that are re-rendering frequently.
2. Implement `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3. Move expensive computations to Web Workers or optimize them with memoization.
