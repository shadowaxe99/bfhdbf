# Deployment Guide

## Introduction

This guide covers the steps required to deploy the Elysium Innovations Developer Tools, which are part of the Elysium OS ecosystem. The deployment process includes preparing the build, setting up the server environment, and deploying the application for use.

## Preparing the Build

Before deploying, ensure that your application is ready to be built for production. This involves running tests, optimizing the code, and compiling the TypeScript files into JavaScript.

### Building the Application

Run the following command to create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will create a `build` directory with the production-ready files.

## Server Setup

Choose a server that meets the requirements of Elysium OS. The server should support Node.js and have the necessary resources to handle the expected load.

### Installing Node.js

Install Node.js on your server:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Setting Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.elysiumos.com
REACT_APP_BLOCKCHAIN_URL=https://arbitrum.elysiumos.com
```

## Deploying the Application

You can deploy the application using various methods such as FTP, SSH, or a continuous integration and deployment service (CI/CD).

### Using FTP

Upload the contents of the `build` directory to your server's web root directory using an FTP client.

### Using SSH

Transfer the build files to your server using `scp`:

```bash
scp -r build/* user@yourserver.com:/path/to/webroot
```

### Using CI/CD

If you are using a CI/CD pipeline, configure it to build the application and deploy the `build` directory to your server after successful tests.

## Post-Deployment

After deploying the application, perform the following checks:

- Verify that the application is running by accessing your domain.
- Check the console for any errors.
- Ensure that the environment variables are correctly set.
- Test the application functionality.

## Rollback Procedure

In case of any issues, you should have a rollback procedure in place:

- Keep backups of previous builds.
- Document the deployment process to revert to a previous version quickly.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Set up monitoring tools to keep track of the application's performance and uptime. Regularly update the server and application to maintain security and performance.

## Conclusion

Deployment is a critical phase, and following these steps will help ensure that the Elysium Innovations Developer Tools are deployed successfully within the Elysium OS ecosystem.
