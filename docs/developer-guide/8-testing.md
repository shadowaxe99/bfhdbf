# Testing Guide

## Introduction

Testing is a critical part of the software development lifecycle. This guide outlines the testing strategy for the Elysium Innovations Developer Tools, focusing on ensuring that AI agents operate effectively within the Elysium OS ecosystem.

## Unit Testing

### Structure

Unit tests should be co-located with their corresponding module. For a component `OrbitAIDevelopmentKit.tsx`, the test file should be named `OrbitAIDevelopmentKit.test.tsx`.

### Framework and Tools

- We use Jest as our primary testing framework.
- React Testing Library for testing React components.
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) to mock API calls.

### Example

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import OrbitAIDevelopmentKit from '../components/OrbitAIDevelopmentKit/OrbitAIDevelopmentKit';

test('renders Orbit AI Development Kit component', () => {
  render(<OrbitAIDevelopmentKit />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/Orbit AI Development Kit/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

## Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that different parts of the application work together as expected.

### Strategy

- Use Jest for running integration tests.
- Test interaction between components and the Redux store.
- Test interaction between components and context providers.

### Example

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from '../store';
import App from '../App';

test('integration test for app initialization', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(
    <Provider store={store}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  );

  fireEvent.click(getByText(/Initialize Orbit/i));

  // Assertions for expected state after initialization
});
```

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests simulate real user scenarios.

### Framework and Tools

- Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Test scenarios that cover the full functionality of the AI agents within the Orbit.

### Example

```typescript
describe('Orbit AI Agent Interaction', () => {
  it('should allow users to interact with AI agents', () => {
    cy.visit('/');

    cy.findByRole('button', { name: /Talk to AI/i }).click();
    cy.findByRole('textbox').type('Hello, AI!');
    cy.findByRole('button', { name: /Send/i }).click();

    cy.contains('Hello, Human!').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

## Performance Testing

Performance tests ensure that the application performs well under various conditions.

### Tools

- Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, and SEO.
- Load testing with Artillery or similar tools.

### Example

```json
{
  "config": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "phases": [
      { "duration": 60, "arrivalRate": 10 }
    ]
  },
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "flow": [
        { "get": { "url": "/" } },
        { "think": 1 },
        { "get": { "url": "/ai-agents" } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests ensure that the application is usable by people with various disabilities.

### Tools

- Axe-core for automated accessibility tests.
- Manual testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### Example

```typescript
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from '../App';
import { axe, toHaveNoViolations } from 'jest-axe';

expect.extend(toHaveNoViolations);

test('App component should have no accessibility violations', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<App />);
  const results = await axe(container);
  expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
});
```

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that tests are run automatically on every push to the repository.

### Configuration

- Use GitHub Actions or a similar CI service.
- Run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on every push.
- Run performance and accessibility tests on a scheduled basis.

### Example

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Run End-to-End Tests
      run: npm run test:e2e
```

## Conclusion

Testing is an integral part of the development process for Elysium Innovations Developer Tools. By following this guide, developers can ensure that their AI agents and the surrounding infrastructure are robust, performant, and accessible.
